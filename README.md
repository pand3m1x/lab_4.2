READ ME Reflection for module 4 lab 4.2

How did array methods like push() and filter() help you manipulate data in this activity?
	a: Honestly, I am still confused. My classmates were very helpful in the item list activity, and while there was a lot of conversations, I was having computer problems those days, so it was difficult to follow. So I've spent a lot of time watching Youtube videos to explain thing.

What challenges did you face when trying to filter and search for items in the array?
	a: Everything. I think figuring out what the HTML code needs to make the javascript work was difficult to understand. I had issues with ordering things correctly so the wrong thing wasn't taking over something else. 

How would you modify this code to make it more efficient or user-friendly?
	a: I guess this is where CSS would come in? We didn't set it up so 'enter' key doesn't work with input, which is useful for people who use keyboards. A print/mail list option? So once the list was completed the user could have a copy of the list. It could be optimized for mobile devices. And maybe a priority option, or a way to order things by catergory, for people shopping at multiple locations.
